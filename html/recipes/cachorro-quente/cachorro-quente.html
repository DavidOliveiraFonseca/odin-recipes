    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When people talk about Brazilian food, they don’t often bring up hot dogs. But something special happens to hot dogs in the hands of Brazilians. </p>
    <p>Some might say the Brazilian hot dog puts the American hot dog to shame. But maybe it’s just a different species of the same family. And the Brazilian species is mightier.</p>
    <p>The key to the Brazilian hot dog’s success is in pile-driving ingredients on top. The wiener itself is nothing special; rather, the stars of the show are the toppings.</p>
    <p>A typical completo hot dog will likely include most, if not all, of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seasoned ground beef</li>
      <li>A pico de gallo-like blend of bell peppers, tomatoes and onion</li>
      <li>Canned corn and peas</li>
      <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Shredded carrots</li>
      <li>Diced ham or bacon</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>Shoestring potato sticks</li>
      <li>A hardboiled quail egg</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some enterprising carts even layer the bun with a soft bed of mashed potatoes, better for the sausage to lie in before getting buried by toppings. It’s served with a tiny spoon.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a normal Hot Dog</li>

      <li>The more the better</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
